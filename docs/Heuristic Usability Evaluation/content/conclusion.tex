\section{Conclusion}

After receiving the evaluation from the team we saw multiple oversights of different severity in our project design that have been spotted by one or more members of the evaluating team. We gained a lot of useful insight of problems users could experience so we concluded that we should fix them, improving the overall design of our application. Now with the implemented changes, it is easier for users to use the application without encountering any major problems and serious confusions. 

From the response that we received from the evaluators and the way we changed our design, we can conclude that a heuristic usability evaluation provides valuable information about the design of an interface from multiple perspectives. In future work, we will make sure to spend time on the user interface evaluation using all available techniques.
