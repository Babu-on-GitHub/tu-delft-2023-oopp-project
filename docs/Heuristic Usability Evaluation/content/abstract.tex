This report presents the results of a heuristic usability evaluation conducted on a prototype of our application, done by a team of students. The aim of the evaluation was to identify various potential or existing problems users could encounter with our application. Evaluators were instructed on how to properly evaluate our project using 10 heuristics as well as how to constructively formulate the found problems. They found multiple minor problems, for example lack of cancel buttons or the dangers of how easy is to delete whole boards. Results were examined and the improvements inspired by the problems investigators found have been implemented in our project.
