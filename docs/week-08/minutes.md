# DEADLINES

this friday -> next tuesday (should include product)


# Testing

We can get sufficient for testings

We should improve coverage for other rubrics

Features are graded based on the video

Application is not really tested (just to see it works) - course policy :)))

# Self-reflection

Reference the material. It's enought just to do quick references.

I can help if you want - Daniel

# Finalising the project

Team deadlines stay the same despite the changed project deadlines.

FOR HEURISTIC WE NEED ANOTHER PROTOTYPE THAT REFLECTS CHANGES.

# Examination

We need to know concepts about teamwork.

Everyone needs to understand every part of the code.
