# Notes from the week 7 meeting (28/3)

## Plan for the next week
* Time to finish MVP: none, it is done. There are some bugs to fix, but overall it is complete.
* Multiboard: can be finished until 03/29, only add admin features.
* Card edit menu for Mate, Roman, that should, and could be done until 04/01.
* Tags search/adding/deletion/updating: until 04/07, do as much as possible.
* Customization: supposedly 04/03, but only if we have time left.
* Keyboard shortcuts: 04/07, but only if we have enough time left.

## Team Self-reflection
* Give some thought.
* Read about it on the oopp website, and pay a lot of attention, since attention is the main issue of ours.

## Video
*** Robert on a plane? ***
* Should be a video demo, similar to what we show on the meeting. Only the interface. Imagine that you have a client, which asked you to do a product, and you want to show it. 
* Deadline is on 03/31, we will meet on 03/30: we will have enough time.
* As part of the video we will need to have a presentation, script and a recording.
* So on 03/31 we should record a write script, and make a presentation. Since Robert is absent, there is no point in making high quality video..

## Technology evaluation
Everything is good

## Heuristic usability evaluation
* Pay much more attention to the evaluations, make them more concise, reference the heuristic usability principles (one of the 10).
* Include the final prototype at the end, even if didn't change much.

## Doing enough
* Mate did the less in terms of code lines, thus he should make the largest contribution.

## Future meetings
* The future meetings are 25 minutes long, 20 minutes shorter than before. The new time period knows only the TA.
