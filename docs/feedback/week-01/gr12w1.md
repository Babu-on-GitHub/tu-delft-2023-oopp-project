## Formative feedback for group 12 - Week 1

#### 1) Self-organization

Excellent: The team was in charge and mostly self-determined, having respectful debates for every decision. The input distribution was almost equal, but I recommend that the members who spoke less try to contribute more in future meetings.

#### 2) Suggested Topics

Excellent: The discussion was very well moderated, covering all of the suggested topics and prioritising them.
