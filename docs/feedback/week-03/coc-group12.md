# Code of conduct

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The students have added a single file to their repository and put it in the right place.

### General

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Added enough detail to all sections without rambling to get enough points. Clear and concise.

### Assignment Description

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: All information is correct and detailed enough, without unnecessary information. 

### Products

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: All information is correct and detailed enough, without unnecessary information. 

### Planning

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Clear, realistic and well-structured goals and agreements which are reflected in Git usage.

### Communication

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Plan for which channels to use for which information. But what kind of discussions / decisions will be carried out over which channels? It would be useful to include examples such as choosing when to meet besides the TA meetings / informing the TA that a document has been uploaded / helping team members stuck on an assignment.

### Commitment

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Mentions a concrete way to determine quality, but what is the minimum quality the team would like to see in terms of group work and chairs/minute takers and how do you convey the quality of group work and chairs/minute takers to each other?

### Division of Tasks and Roles

Feedback: Very good. Consider using GitLab issues to reflect the roles of chair / minute-taker: create issues such as uploading agenda / notes which are time-sensitive and assigned to the correct team members.

### Meetings

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: No clear decision. It would be useful to start off with an estimate of how often it would be necessary to meet once you start working on the product. Of course, this estimate can be updated in the future. Also, how do you conduct non-TA meetings? Do they have any structure?

### Decision Making

Mark: Excellent

### Dealing with Conflicts

Mark: Very good

Feedback: Agreements on how to deal with conflicts and escaladations of conflict. Also discussed is when to involve the TA. But how exactly can the TA be expected to help?

### Guidance
 
Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Realistic expectations, inspired by course information and discussed with the TA. What can you not expect from the TA?

### Consequences

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: No clear agreement. What should concretely happen? Try to come up with appropriate consequences for possible 'mistakes' someone might make. What do you do if someone is late / misses a meeting without informing the team / misses non-TA meetings / doesn't complete a task they are assigned?

### Success Factors
 
Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Try to come up with something that really relates to the team. Why are enthusiastic about this project?

### Norms or Evaluation Criteria

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The criteria are good, but are mostly inspired by basic course requirements. Consider explaining why they are important to the team.
